# RefactoringToPatternsJava

This is an effort to step through the refactorings provided in Joshua Kirievsky's "Refactoring to Patterns" book. It includes step-by-step commits of all of the code and tests necessary to see the changes as the code is refactored.

The effort originally started by using Kireivsky's paper [Refactoring to Patterns](http://www.tarrani.net/RefactoringToPatterns.pdf) Then it brought in some examples from the [book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/85041.Refactoring_to_Patterns).

The refactorings included here are:
Replace Conditional Logic with Strategy
Replace Implicit Tree with Composite
Encapsulate Composite with Builder
Compose Method
Encapsulate Classes with Factory
Chain Constructors
Replace Conditional Dispatcher with Command
Encapsulate Composite with Builder Revisited (add the ability to output JSON)
